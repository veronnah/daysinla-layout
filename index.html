			<div class = "descr1"><p>Los Angeles is a city that never ceases to surprise in the best way possible, from the diverse range of <a href="https://www.smallworldthisis.com/where-to-eat-los-angeles/">restaurants</a> to the neighborhoods that can feel like different worlds. I’ve lived and visited countless times, and realized that I’ve only started scratching the surface of this complex city. The truth is that planning a trip to LA, whether it’s for <a href="https://www.smallworldthisis.com/los-angeles-itinerary-2-days/">2 days</a> or an entire week can be overwhelming and trying to fit a hundred things into one visit just isn’t practical. Instead focus on a few main sights a day, ideally within the same area (because otherwise you will just spend your time in the car, most likely in traffic). Here’s a mix of popular sights as well as a few lesser-known spots to consider adding to your Los Angeles itinerary for 5 days.</p>
				<h3 id = "sometext1" >A complete Los Angeles itinerary for 5 days</h3>
				<div >Start on the Westside, where you can explore classic LA beach towns like Santa Monica and Venice.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class = "place2">
		<div class ="place_2">
			<div class = "descr2">
			<h2 id = "sometext2" ><strong>Day 1: West LA</strong></h2>
			<p>For breakfast, head to <strong>Gjusta</strong> for their in-house smoked lox on an open-face bagel or a breakfast egg sandwich. Don’t be scared off by the homeless encampment nearby or the complicated ordering system. Venice is indeed a city of contrasts. Walk the few blocks to the beach and wander around the <strong>Venice Beach Boardwalk</strong> for some prime people watching. Afterwards, drive to the <strong>Venice Canals</strong> for some solitude (and serious waterfront house envy).
			</p>
			<p>For lunch, <strong>Café Gratitude</strong> is as West LA as it gets with its creative vegan food (try the popular macrobiotic bowl). Afterwards, stop by <strong>Moon Juice</strong> across the street for an array of juices and powders that will cure anything, just not sticker shock.
			</p>
			<p>In the afternoon, make your way to <strong>Santa Monica Pier</strong> and after you get your fill of the sights, walk over to the adjacent beach and stick your toes in that warm California sand. For dinner, <strong>Milo and Olive</strong>, has no shortage of carbs in the form of pizza and pasta. The garlic knots and burrata prosciutto pizza are highly recommended. The <strong>Urth Caffe</strong>, is a great after-dinner spot to hang out on the heated patio with a pot of herbal tea and a fruit tart if you still have room.
			</p>
			</div>
			<img class = "pic2" src = "../../imges/los-angeles-itinerary-5-days-1-of-1-1024x682.jpg">

	</section>
	<section class = "place3">
		<div class ="place_3">
			<div class = "descr3">
			<h2 id = "sometext4" ><strong>Day 2: Central LA</strong></h2>
			<p>Start your day off at <strong>Kismet</strong> with a Turkish-ish breakfast, a sharable platter of small dishes including soft-boiled egg with sumac and marinated Persian cucumbers with labneh. Take a short hike up to the <a href = "http://www.griffithobservatory.org/">Griffith Observatory</a> and soak in the spectacular views of this sprawling city.
			</p>
			<p>Head to <strong>In-N-Out</strong> on Sunset Boulevard for a late lunch of a classic double double (two burger patties) and animal-style fries (melted cheese and grilled onions). Take a stroll down the <strong>Hollywood Walk Of Fame.</strong> It’s not at all like it’s portrayed in the movies, but it’s worth checking out the different celebrities’ stars. Historical sights like the <strong>TLC Chinese Theater</strong> and <strong>Roosevelt Hotel</strong> are also worth stopping by.
			</p>
			<p>For dinner, <strong>Luv2Eat Thai Bistro</strong> in Hollywood is ideal for delicious, authentic Thai food. For night owls, the iconic <strong>Hollywood Forever Cemetery</strong> hosts movie nights or get your fill of comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater on Sunset Boulevard. If you’re tired and just want a sweet treat, <strong>Yogurt Stop</strong> is the place to go for frozen yogurt with homemade baked goods toppings.
			</p>

			<div class = "descr4">
			<h2 id = "sometext5" ><strong>Day 3: West/Central LA </strong></h2>
			<p>Stop at the iconic <strong>Bob’s Coffee and Doughnuts</strong> in the <strong>Original Farmers Market</strong> to help fuel your morning with a bit of sugar and caffeine. For all the juice shops and grain bowls in LA, there are cult followings for donuts shops and this one has stood the test of time. After breakfast the choice is yours: for art enthusiasts the <a href = "https://www.lacma.org/">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</a> is one of the largest art museums in the western U.S. or for archeology fans the adjacent <strong>La Brea Tar Pits</strong> is not to be missed.
			</p>
			<p>Come back to the Farmers Market for lunch, where you can choose from food stalls like <strong>Pampas Grill</strong> for Brazilian BBQ. For another essential LA experience, head to <strong>The Grove</strong> for dessert, and grab a <strong>Sprinkles</strong> cupcake on your way out to the (overpriced) parking lot.
			</p>
			<p>For dinner, stop by <strong>Jon and Vinny’s</strong> for pizza and pasta that will not disappoint. Make sure to make reservations in advance. Afterward, walk down <strong>Melrose Avenue</strong> for some shopping, and then pick-up dessert nearby at <strong>Milk</strong>, a dessert spot known for their macaroon ice cream sandwiches in flavors like Thai ice tea and red velvet.

			<div class = "descr4">
			<h2 id = "sometext5" ><strong>Day 4: Downtown LA </strong></h2>
			<p>There’s nothing better than a classic diner in <a href="https://www.smallworldthisis.com/downtown-los-angeles-travel/">downtown LA</a> and <strong>Nickel Diner</strong> has it all: a retro interior, memorable diner fare, and most importantly delicious maple bacon donuts. Afterward, take a free audio tour of the <strong>Walt Disney Concert Hall</strong> and admire its impressive architecture by Frank Gehry that optimizes the interior acoustics. Head out to the shaded elevated garden for a break and a view of downtown.
			</p>
			<p>For lunch, go to <strong>Grand Central Market</strong>, a trendy food court that offers everything from tacos at <strong>Villa Moreliana</strong> to Thai Street food at <strong>Sticky Rice.</strong> Walk off lunch by taking the cable car up to <strong>Angels Flight</strong> (across the street from Grand Central Market), and take in the view of downtown from above.
			</p>
			<p>Make your way to <strong>Japantown</strong>, in the late afternoon to walk around this historic neighborhood of LA before dinner. Pop into <strong>Fugetsu-Do</strong>, one of the oldest mochi shops in the area. Get in line early for Daikokuya for ramen, because there will be a line. For dessert get freshly made imagawayaki (red bean cakes) at <strong>Mitsuru Café</strong> The 24-hour <strong>Wi Spa</strong> in Koreatown is a great place to unwind in the various sauna rooms and single-sex hot tubs (be prepared for a strict no swimsuit policy). There’s also a rooftop area for lounging amid the skyscrapers of downtown.

			<h2 id = "sometext5" ><strong>Day 5: Malibu</strong></h2>
			<p>Grab breakfast at <strong>Bagel Nosh Deli</strong> in Santa Monica on your way out to Malibu. The bagels are some of the best on the Westside, and they also offer heartier options like eggs, bacon and pancakes. Visit the stunning <a href="http://www.getty.edu/visit/villa/">Getty Villa</a> (if you want to get technical it’s actually in Pacific Palisades). Admire the impressive collection of art and enviable view of the ocean. A tour of the grounds can be done in about an hour and it’s recommended that you go before noon to beat the crowds. Entry is free, but reservations are recommended. Parking cost $15.
			</p>
			<p>If you’re going to be in Malibu, you should definitely take advantage of the fresh seafood. <strong>Malibu Seafood</strong> is a popular spot known for its fish and chips, clam chowder, and ahi tuna burgers. Seating is limited to outside, so make sure to bring layers in case the sea breeze picks up.
			</p>
			<p>Since you’re on the coast, you might as well go beach-hopping. Start at <strong>Point Dume</strong>, afterward head to <strong>Zuma</strong>, and finish off with the rugged <strong>El Matador</strong> that tends to be less crowded than the other two (with limited parking as well). Get dinner at <strong>Malibu Farm Restaurant</strong>, where you’ll have a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, and can enjoy a California-style menu with fresh produce and locally-sourced ingredients in the form of salads, tacos and small plates.
			</p>
			<p>Afterward, go for a drink at <strong>The Surfrider Malibu’s</strong> rooftop bar and soak in yet another view of the Pacific, because honestly it never gets old.</p>

		<h2 id = "sometext6">Essential info</h2>
		<h2 id = "sometext7">Los Angeles orientation</h2>
		<p>Los Angeles is roughly divided up into 6 major regions. There are of course many more neighborhoods within these areas, but these are the ones that will most likely be included in your Los Angeles itinerary for 5 days. Let’s start with the neighborhoods closest to the ocean and move east.</p>
		<div>					<p><strong>West</strong> (Santa Monica, Venice, Beverley Hills)</p>

								<p><strong>Central</strong> (Hollywood, West Hollywood, Fairfax)</p>

								<p><strong>Downtown</strong> (Koreatown, Little Tokyo, Chinatown)</p>

								<p><strong>East</strong> (Los Feliz, Silver Lake, Echo Park, Pasadena, East LA, San Gabriel Valley)</p>

								<p><strong>The Valley</strong> (Burbank, Studio City, North Hollywood)</p>

								<p><strong>South</strong> (Long Beach, Manhattan Beach)</p>
		</div>
		<h2 id = "sometext8">Getting around Los Angeles</h2>
		<p>The LA sprawl is real, and renting a car at the airport (<a href="https://link.hertz.com/link.html?id=31322&LinkType=HZLK&AID=11140156&PID=7912517&icid_source=Small+World+This+Is&cjevent=a3dc0ce06f4011ea8287005d0a18050f&c3ch=CJ&c3nid=CJ-4619950">Hertz</a> is my go-to) is your best bet to getting around with relative ease and will allow you to visit all the destinations on your Los Angeles itinerary for 5 days. There are public transportation options like the <a href="https://www.metro.net/">Metro</a>, which can be great for getting to various destinations like downtown where it can be difficult to find parking. If braving Los Angeles freeways are not your thing (I hear you) car sharing services like Uber and Lyft, are aplenty and also a great option for when you want to go out at night.</p>
		<h3 id = "sometext9"><a href="https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/reservation/?targetPage=reservationOnHomepage.jsp&refererUrl=&searchString=&id=31322&LinkType=HZLK">Book your rental car here</a></h3>
		<h2 id = "sometext10">Los Angeles Airports</h2>
		<p><p>Los Angeles has a few different airport options within the city, each with their own list of pros and cons.</p>
		<p><strong>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)</strong>-the city’s main airport located on the west side. Crowded, chaotic, and likely where you’ll be coming through, especially if you are on an international flight. The upside is that there are some good food and drink options, like Shake Shack, Umami Burger, and Angel City Brewery.</p>
		<p><strong>Long Beach (LGB)</strong>-the opposite of LAX, where rumor has it you can get there a mere hour before and easily make it to your gate without breaking a sweat.</p>
		<p><strong>Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR)</strong>-located in the land of film and TV studios, this smaller airport usually promises a pleasant experience. Coincidentally, it is the shortest distance to Hollywood.</p>
		<p><strong>John Wayne Airport (SNA)</strong> – even though it’s located a bit further in Orange County, it is worth mentioning. It’s about an hour away from LA and is a breeze to fly into, but can be inconvenient if your staying in Los Angeles and don’t want to deal with traffic (though it’s a great home base for Disneyland trips).</p>
		</p>
		<h2 id = "sometext11">Safety in LA</h2>
		<p>One of the biggest issues that Los Angeles continues to struggle with is the staggering homeless population. From downtown to Venice Beach, do not be alarmed if you see entire streets filled with homeless encampments. In general, homeless people are harmless, but use precaution when walking in areas like downtown (avoid Skid Row), especially at night. Just like you would in any other major city, be aware of your surroundings.</p>
		<h2 id = "sometext12">Los Angeles weather</h2>
		<p>Los Angeles has near perfect weather, with mostly sunny days year around. There is of course the odd rainy day, especially in the winter. It can also get chilly in the winter, especially at night. The weather in June is famously known as June Gloom, because of the fog that rolls in off the ocean and keeps the city cool. The ideal time to visit is in March-May or September-November when the weather is a bit cooler, the air cleaner, and there are fewer crowds.</p>
		<h2 id = "sometext13">Where to stay in Los Angeles</h2>
		<p>Ideally, for 5 days in Los Angeles, the central part of the city is a good spot to call home. A home base in the greater Hollywood area for example will give you easier access to the west and east parts of the LA, instead of staying on the Westside and having to drive all the way across town to sights on the Eastside or vice versa.</p>
		<h2 id = "sometext14"><a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/trylon.en.html?aid=1488016&no_rooms=1&group_adults=1">Trylon Hotel</a></h2>
		<p>A smaller independently-owned hotel that is centrally located in Hollywood. Walking distance to Hollywood Boulevard (Hollywood Walk Of Fame, TCL Chinese Theater), but not right on it. A great alternative to the bigger chains in the area. Great value for the location, and amenities.</p>
		<h2 id = "sometext15"><a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/holiday-inn-express-hollywood-walk-of-fame.en.html?aid=1488016&no_rooms=1&group_adults=1">HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME</a></h2>
		<p>This reliable hotel chain offers an excellent option in Hollywood, that is a short walk away from Hollywood Boulevard, as well as a short drive (or Metro ride) from other popular attractions like Sunset Boulevard and Universal Studios. The rooms are spacious and a hearty breakfast is included in your stay.</p>
		<h2 id = "sometext15"><a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/h-roosevelt-hollywood-california.en.html?aid=1488016&no_rooms=1&group_adults=1">THE HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT</a></h2>
		<p>If you want to treat yourself to classic Hollywood glamour, this is the hotel to stay in. Once home to stars like Marilyn Monroe, this 4-star hotel is located right on Hollywood Boulevard, and pulls out all the stops. Highlights include a rooftop terrace, the hotel’s famous outdoor pool, and notable restaurants and bars.</p>

		<h2 id = "sometext16"><a href="https://www.smallworldthisis.com/best-places-to-stay-in-la/">WHERE TO STAY IN LOS ANGELES (NEIGHBORHOOD GUIDES + HOTELS)</a></h2>
		<p>There you have it, a Los Angeles itinerary for 5 days and a brief introduction to this complex and fascinating city. Once you have your first visit under your belt, if you come back again continue to dig a little deeper beyond the main sights. There’s so much the city has to offer if you are willing to take the time to explore.</p>

			<p>Hi Julia</p>
			<p>My 26 yo daughter and me want to explore California / Los Angeles in September. Unfortunately, we have just 5 days to travel and also a limited budget.
			I am taking note of all your suggestion and I would appreciate a recommendation of a nice and safe place with affordable cost for stay.</p>
			<p>I am already looking at Airbnb, but because I know anything about LA, I am afraid to make a bad choose. Your help is more than welcoming.</p>
			<p>Thank you</p>

				<p>HI Helen, some central neighborhoods I would recommend to stay in an Airbnb or budget hotel would be West Hollywood or Mid-Century area (near The Grove shopping center). Since LA is a huge city, being in the center will give you better access to West LA (Santa Monica, Venice), Downtown, East LA, etc. Have a great trip!</p>
				<p>Also, check out my where to stay in LA guide for more recommendations:</p>
